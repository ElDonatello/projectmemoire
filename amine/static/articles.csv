Several of those interviewed for the report say they don't feel their loved one's cases have the attention of the highest levels of government. In particular, family members of Americans who are detained by foreign governments on trumped-up charges say they feel those cases are less of a priority to the U.S. government than cases involving hostage-taking by militant or criminal groups.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced Tuesday the Federal Aviation Administration will award the money to 72 airports as part of the Trump administration's newly created Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act Airport Grant Program. The program is aimed at providing relief to U.S. families, workers, and businesses. A news release from the FAA said the money will support continuing operations and replace lost revenue resulting from the sharp decline in passenger traffic and other airport business due to the pandemic. The funds are available for airport capital expenditures, airport operating expenses including payroll and utilities, and airport debt payments. For example, Charlotte Douglas International Airport will receive $138.5 million and Raleigh-Durham International Airport is receiving more than $49 mi (+622 chars)"

Shane Henderson was the president of the now-defunct Gilco Contracting, based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued the citations in 2005 and 2008, The Commercial Dispatch reported Sunday. Most of the violations were for failure to meet excavation and protective system requirements, according to the Dispatch's review of OSHA inspection records. Three more citations were levied against Southern Civil Contracting - owned by Henderson and also based in Tuscaloosa - in 2010, its first year of existence. Since then, OSHA has not cited the company, according to the newspaper.
